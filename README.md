Java to interpret text with a file by character
This program takes a text file, reads through the characters and provides output based on the character
In this example it outputs audio using the files I've provided
This was built using pieces of code and is not optimized. I'm working on using a variable to replace the path for file locations
Additionally I have not included the input file I use since it should be usable for any file. 
I'm planning on changing the input to be an argv type of input, so when run it can either ask for a file or use raw input when run
This is my first java program
